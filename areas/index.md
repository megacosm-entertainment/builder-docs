# Area Editor

---

The area editor will typically be utilized by the Head Builder to create or modify areas as a whole. It allows for setting almost all aspects of a zone, from the vnums that make up the zones to flags that impact who can access it and how. Finally, use of the area editor is required for setting the description and notes that will be seen by players looking for information about a given zone.
