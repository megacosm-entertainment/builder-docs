# Builders Beware!
---
This site is meant to serve as a guide for the OLC (On-Line Creation) system in use at SentienceMUD. While Sentience is derived from ROM, there have been many changes made over the years, so some of the [traditional building guides](https://web.archive.org/web/20011205235316/http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Dome/4876/) are no longer very relevant.

# Imm Prompt Suggestion
General prompt:
```
 {W%o {g%O{X%c{WRoom: {g%R {D({W%z:{g} %r{D)>{X%c
```
This does the following:

If actively editing anything, it will show the editor in white, with the vnum being edited in dark green.

The second line (after %c) shows "Room:" in white, with the current room vnum in dark green, and then in dark grey parens, the area name in white, and room name in dark green. Finally, it ends with another newline.
