# Area Scripts
---

As the name suggests, area scripts are scripts that are attached to a zone as a whole, as opposed to any given room, object, mob, or token. At present, area scripts will only fire on random tick or area reset triggers.

When writing area scripts, script commands will need to be prefaced with `area`.
